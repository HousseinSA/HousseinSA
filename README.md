I've always been a tech enthusiast, fascinated by the amazing world of technology. I enjoyed tweaking my computer and smartphone, adding mods to them. Then, I decided to enter the programming world to create things that others could see and be amazed by. Since I like people to see my work, I leaned more towards frontend development. I've been enjoying working with all its languages and technologies. I love to read, taking walks, singing, and playing guitars.
